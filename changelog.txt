SPATIAL CHANGELOGS

v2.0
Complete rewrite of the module.
- The module now takes into account the size of items. As a result only tables can be added to the hash, And each item has a bounding box (x, y, width, height)
- Simplified some of the API (update_item_cell() became update() etc)
- Bunch of other changes. The readme has been updated to reflect all the changes.

v1.1
BUGFIXES:
- Changed the remove function to actually work.

CHANGES:
- Now, If the item being added to the database is a table, A table will be added to the item called _SPATIAL.
  It contains the following things:
  - spatial: A reference to the database it's in.
  - cell_x & cell_y: Coordinates of the cell the item lives in.
  - cell: Reference to the cell the item is in.

- Added a new method called update_item_cell that will move an item to a new cell based on world coordinates
